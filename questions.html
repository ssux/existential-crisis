                            <p><h3>The writer Kierkegaard suggested that all despair has its origins in the self, a concept he defined (somewhat confusingly!) as follows:</p></h3>
                            <p><h4>The human being is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates
                            to itself, or that in the relation which is its relating to itself. The self is not the relation but the relation's relating to itself.
                            A human being is the synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity. In short,
                            a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between the two terms. Looked at in this way a human being is not yet a self.</h4></p>

                            <p><h3>Kierkegaard was a Christian writer, so his idea of the self was heavily influenced by beliefs about the mind and the body.
                            In short, the self is found in the balanced relationship between the body and the soul, forming its own holy trinity. The self is how one
                            balances the inherent antinomy of the physical and the metaphysical: finitude and infinitude, temporality and eternality, worldly necessity
                            and possibility.</h3></p>
