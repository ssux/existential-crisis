                        <div id="o2-4a1"><p><h3>The absurd is exactly what you may be feeling right now. We want the world to make sense, and have meaning. At the same time, when we see actually look at the world around us, we find ourselves confronted with &ldquo;the unreasonable silence of the world.&rdquo;</h3></p></div>
                        <div id="o2-4a2"><p><h3>The absurd isn&#8217;t just about having either realization. Instead, the absurd is what happens when you acknowledge both of them <i>at the same time.</i></h3></p></div>
                        <button id="o2-5">So the world has no meaning?</button>
                        <div id="o2-5a1"><p><h1>Objectively? Perhaps not.</h1></p></div>
                        <div id="o2-5a2"><p><h3>That&#8217;s not to say there&#8217;s no meaning to anything, of course. One could say that the world is what you make of it! Do your best!</h3></p></div>
                        <button id="o2-6">Should I just kill myself?</button>
                        <div id="o2-6a1"><p><h1>Hold on a minute!</h1></p></div>
                        <div id="o2-6a2"><p><h3>Don&#8217;t be hasty, the world being meaningless doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not worth living! Although Camus did call suicide the &ldquo;only one really serious philosophical problem,&rdquo; because at its core, all philosophy is concerned with whether life is truly worth living, he did conclude that suicide is not the answer!</h3></p></div>
                        <div id="o2-6a3"><p><h3>It&#8217;s not hard to see where you&#8217;re coming from, of course. But to quote the man himself,</h3></p><p><h4>In a sense, and as in melodrama, killing yourself amounts to confessing. It is confessing that life is too much for you or that you do not understand it. Let&#8217;s not go too far in such analogies, however, but rather return to everyday words. It is merely confessing that that &ldquo;is not worth the trouble.&rdquo; Living, naturally, is never easy. You continue making the gestures commanded by existence for many reasons, the first of which is habit. Dying voluntarily implies that you have recognized, even instinctively, the ridiculous character of that habit, the absence of any profound reason for living, the insane character of that daily agitation, the uselessness of suffering.</h4></p><p><h5>Albert Camus, The Myth of Sisyphus</h5></p></div>
                        <button id="o2-7">I&#8217;m still not seeing how this is you talking me out of suicide as the answer.</button>
                        <div id="o2-7a1"><p><h3>Think of it this way: killing yourself is <i>an</i> answer. It&#8217;s not a good one, though, in an existential or reasoned sense.</h3></p> <p><h3>First off, you haven&#8217;t answered the question of the absurd at all! You negate the question by avoiding it entirely. In other words, suicide is a way to avoid confronting the absurd and what it might mean for you.</h3></p></div>
                        <div id="o2-7a2"><p><h3>Secondly, settling on suicide as the response to the world lacking objective meaning means you&#8217;re working from the premise that life is not worth living if there&#8217;s no greater meaning to it.</h3></p><p><h1>But is that even true?</h1></p></div>
                        <button id="o2-8">Then how should I live with this knowledge?</button>
                        <div id="o2-8a1"><p><h3>In a sense the absurd seems like a question that you must resolve in some way. But do you really have to?</h3></p></div>
                        <div id="o2-8a2"><p><h3>Camus would argue that the best way to handle the absurd is to live with it, and be conscious of the absurdity of existence at every moment. In fact, what better way could there be to enrich the experience of living? </h3></p></div>
