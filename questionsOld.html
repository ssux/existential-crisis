                            <p><h4>The human being is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates
                            to itself, or that in the relation which is its relating to itself. The self is not the relation but the relation's relating to itself.
                            A human being is the synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity. In short,
                            a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between the two terms. Looked at in this way a human being is not yet a self.</h4></p>

                            In short, the self is found in the balanced relationship between the body and the soul, forming its own holy trinity. The self is how one
                            balances the inherent antinomy of the physical and the metaphysical: finitude and infinitude, temporality and eternality, worldly necessity
                            and possibility.</h3></p>

                            For instance, if you spent all your time fantasizing instead of paying attention to the real world,
                            you'd be in despair because you're ignoring a part of your own identity. On the other hand, if you're

                            between the body and soul that becomes the self. Note that he also used this to distinguish between
                            true faith and merely going through the motions; he brings up a man who seems like a good Christian who
                            goes to church often, but is too absorbed in the world to ever notice that he himself lacks, well, a self.
                            Faith may not necessarily be your resolution, of course.</h3></p>
